# HTAM--SLEEPY-SLIPPERS
ASSIGNMENT 3

#How might we reinterpret foaming slippers using living biological materials in natural environments?


## Project Overview

This project explores an alternative, low-tech approach to the industrial **compression molding with foaming** process, traditionally used for manufacturing products like foam slippers. Instead of relying on chemical foaming agents (e.g., in PVC/EVA), we draw inspiration from natural expansion processes: **seed germination** and **dough fermentation**.
Our goal is not to replicate the industrial product's durability or efficiency, but to creatively reinterpret the core principle of "expansion molding" in a sustainable, non-toxic, and accessible way, suitable for a FabLab setting.

## Design Challenge

- **Industrial Process:** Compression Molding (Foaming)
- **Reinterpretation Tools/Materials:** Seeds (Mung Beans, Chia) & Dough (Yeast)
- **Context:** Small-scale / Low-tech / FabLab Space

## Background Research

The industrial process for making foam slippers involves three key steps under high heat and pressure:
1.  **Pre-heating (~130°C):** Preparing the unfoamed material.
2.  **Molding & Foaming (~160-165°C):** The material expands (foams) inside the mold due to chemical agents.
3.  **Curing:** The foam structure is set under controlled conditions.

**Limitations we identified:**
- Use of potentially toxic plasticizers.
- High energy consumption.
- Limited potential for customization.

## Our Reinterpretation: Two Bio-Foaming Paths

### Path 1: Seed Germination Foaming

**Concept:** Using the natural swelling force of germinating seeds to act as a "bio-foaming" agent within a gel matrix.

- **Materials:** Mung beans, chia seeds, agar (or other gel), water, 3D-printed or laser-cut molds.
- **Process:**
    1.  Mix seeds into a liquid gel solution.
    2.  Pour the mixture into a mold.
    3.  Keep the mold in a humid environment to encourage germination and expansion.
    4.  The growing seeds displace the gel, creating a dense, foamed structure.

     
### Path 2: Dough Fermentation Foaming（no prototype yet）

**Concept:** Utilizing the gas produced by yeast fermentation to cause dough to rise and expand within a mold, mimicking the foaming process.

- **Materials:** Flour, yeast, sugar, water, mold.
- **Process:**
    1.  Prepare a yeast-activated dough.
    2.  Place the dough into a mold.
    3.  Allow the dough to proof (ferment and rise), filling the mold's volume.
    4.  Bake or dry the dough to set its expanded shape.（BREADDDD SLIPPERS??!）

## Process

### prototyping
We attempted to create a prototype of a "seed slipper" using some waste materials. We made the bottom surface in the shape of a slipper and simulated the positions where plants sprout on it; we fixed it with a transparent mold on the top and added a grid at the bottom to secure the seeds.

Our expected design is to replace the "downward pressure of the mold" with the "outward supporting force of the seed", and to substitute the "mold" with a "container that shapes the seedling of the seed", while omitting the high-temperature step.
The key point is that the slippers produced through this process are basically impossible to wear directly... In this project, what we pursue is not a "100% reproduction of the functions and manufacturing techniques of the product", but to understand the elements involved and then innovatively propose some seemingly impossible alternative solutions. We sincerely hope that this still meets the class requirements.
From the perspective of plant growth, when they wither, perhaps a pair of somewhat sturdy plant-shaped slippers can be formed... This requires experimentation.

I conducted some experiments. It can be seen that I only molded the shape of the sole part of the shoes but did not yet make the upper part of the slippers that covers the foot. Green beans（绿豆） and chia seeds were respectively cultivated on the two surfaces of the sole. Since chia seeds are an invasive species in China, they were deactivated as food - but unfortunately, they still germinated. This is the germination situation of the two plants three days later. I will bring them to class.

### Optimize and iterate
We create a custom foot model using plaster on the current progress. Then, seeds are sown on the surface of the foot model, allowing seeds to make tosprout on the surface of thefoot model to form an
interconnected surface. Simultaneously, tempeh
fungus mycelium can alsobe used for shaping.. Once the mycelium has fully grown, a pair of custom-made slippers that fit the shape of the foot can be produced.

## Reflection & Insights

### Advantages
 **Non-Toxic:** Eliminates the need for synthetic plasticizers and foaming agents.
 **Sustainable:** Utilizes biodegradable and renewable materials.
 **Customizable:** The mold can be easily modified in a FabLab (e.g., via 3D printing) for personalized designs.
 **Low-Tech & Accessible:** The process requires minimal energy and no industrial machinery.

### Challenges
 **Time-Consuming:** Germination and fermentation are slow compared to industrial cycles.
 **Structural Integrity:** The bio-materials lack the strength and durability of industrial polymers.
 **Control:** Managing humidity for seeds and temperature for dough is crucial and can be unpredictable.

### Future Possibilities
 Exploring composite materials (e.g., mycelium with seeds).
 Using digital fabrication to create molds that guide growth patterns.
 Testing other natural expanding materials like sponges or moss.

### Feedback we received at Maker Faire 2025
1. Some people, after learning about our project, felt it resembled Kenya Hara's concept of using alternative technologies to interpret existing designs, as described in *Designing Design*.
2. Many people were concerned about whether the slippers we made would be wearable.
3. Some people found our project concept interesting and eye-catching.
4. Some people were curious about the types of plants we used.
5. A significant number of people were excited upon seeing the loofah（sigua） slippers: "Sigua!"
6. Some people mentioned that if the project were to be implemented, we could explore and optimize its comfort.
7. People placed great importance on the project's feasibility, with many curious about its wearability and durability.
8. People liked biomaterials, finding them particularly environmentally friendly, but hoped we could find more suitable alternatives, such as composite biomaterials.
